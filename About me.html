      Hello Everyone! Iâ€™m Lindsey. I am a rising junior in Massachusetts. I am very interested in STEM, especially technology and do several different extracurriculars around it. I am also a red belt in Kenpo karate. My goal is to achieve black belt by the time I graduate high school. I love being outdoors, spending time with my best friend and listening to music too. I have a dog, named Barnaby. He is a cockapoo, a mix between a cocker spaniel and a poodle. I was born in Oregon, and have now lived in MA for half my life. I also have a twin sister, Julia.
